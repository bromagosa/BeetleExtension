# 3D Beetle Extension
## A Tiny Bit of History
The 3D Beetle extension is heavily inspired in [Beetle Blocks](http://beetleblocks.com) Snap<em>!</em> mod, orignally designed by Eric Rosenbaum and Duks Koschitz and developed by Bernat Romagosa during the years 2014-2020.

Beetle Blocks was aimed at 3D fabrication, especially targetting 3D printing, which is why the 3D Beetle extension also allows exporting the generated geometry for 3D printing.

### If You Were a Beetle Blocks User
Then you should know that the biggest change you'll need to adjust to is that there are **no shape primitives** in the 3D Beetle extension. All possible geometry is generated by extrusion. The rest of the extension should feel very natural for you, as all the other operations have been made to work pretty much identically, and the coordinate system has also been preserved.

Additionally, the 3D Beetle extension provides a few extra operations and features that you will easily adapt to.

You can refer to the blocks reference at the end of this article to learn what every single block does.

## Overview and Abstractions

### The Beetle

The Beetle is a character that can move around 3D space. Here's what it looks like in its default color:

![beetle](beetle.png)

This character is to 3D what the Lego turtle is to 2D. Turtles can move on a 2D plane, but beetles can additionally fly and dig underground, which makes them very apt for exploring the third dimension.

### Movement and Rotation

You can **move** and **rotate** the Beetle by using its particular movement and rotation blocks. These work very much like the usual *Motion* blocks in Snap<em>!</em>, but the extra Z axis makes things slightly more complicated.

![The movement and rotation axes](axes.png)

You can always look at the three axes of rotation -X (blue), Y (red) and Z (green)- to determine what your rotation or movement operation will have the beetle do.

### Extrusion

While moving, the Beetle is also able to generate 3D geometry by means of what we call **extrusion**. Extruding is leaving a 3D trail along a path. Think of it as if the Beetle was carrying a pastry tube, or one of these play dough extruders, with interchangeable headers.

#### Extruding a Point

Extruding a single point will generate a line.

![The beetle has extruded a line along a path](line_extrusion.png)

The ![](start_extruding_block.png) block includes an option in the dropdown menu
for a point, centered right at the center of the beetle.

#### Extruding a Curve

Similarly, extruding a curve will generate a surface. A curve is any collection of points in a 2D plane that don't define a closed polygon.

![The beetle has extruded a curve along a path](curve_extrusion.png)

The ![](start_extruding_block.png) block includes default options in the
dropdown menu for two different curves: semicircle and line. If you want to
extrude a different curve, you can always pass a different collection of 2D
points to the block:

![](start_extruding_point_collection.png)

![The beetle has extruded a curve along a path](custom_curve_extrusion.png)

#### Extruding a Polygon

When extruding a polygon, the Beetle will generate a new prism at each movement step, with its base shaped as said polygon and with the end cap matching the current beetle rotation.

![The beetle has extruded a square along a path](square_extrusion.png)

The ![](start_extruding_block.png) block includes default options in the
dropdown menu for three different polygons: circle, triangle and square. If you
want to extrude a different polygon, you can always pass a different collection
of 2D points to the block, but you need to make sure that the first and last
points are duplicated so that the Beetle knows you mean to extrude a closed
shape:

# Examples

First of all, you will need to open the 3D viewport in order to be able to see the Beetle and the geometries you generate. To do so, navigate to the *3D Beetle* category and click on the button at the top of the blocks palette, labeled *Open 3D Window*.

## Basic Solids

Since the only way to generate volumes with the Beetle is to extrude 2D shapes along a path, it can be interesting to start by taking a look at how to generate a bunch of basic solids.

An important block that you may want to have at hand is ![](reset.png). This block will remove all geometry from the 3D view, and get the Beetle back to its original position.

### Cube

A cube can be understood as an extrusion of a square. Let's begin by selecting the correct extrusion base from the dropdown menu in the following block:

> ![](start_extruding_square_block.png)

You'll notice that the Beetle is now showing that shape around its body.

> ![The Beetle "wearing" a square shape around its
> body](square_extrusion_outline.png)

From this point on, any movement you ask it to perform is going to leave a square trail behind it. To get it to generate a cube, you just need to ask it to walk one single step:

> ![](cube.png)

### Cylinder

Similarly, extruding a circle will produce a cylinder.

> ![](cylinder.png)

### Tube

Here's where things can begin to get a little bit tricky. If you want the cylinder to have no caps -that is, if you want to generate a tube-, you can't rely on a simple prism extrusion. The base shape would need to be a circle with a smaller circular hole in the middle, which is not permitted.

One way to achieve a tube is to extrude a line around a circular path, thus generating the walls of the cylinder one by one as the beetle walks in a circle:

![](tube.gif) ![](tube_code.png)

To change the height of the tube you will need to specify a custom line to extrude:

![](long_tube_code.png)

### Tube with Thick Walls

The previous tube has walls of zero thickness. An easy way to achieve a thick wall is to extrude a custom rectangle along a circular path:

![](thick_glitched_tube_code.png)

Notice how the tube presents a little glitch. The last extrusion step didn't quite close the walls as you may have expected. That is because the extrusion step is performed when the beetle moves, and the beetle moved before the last 15º rotation, when it happened to end up at the same spot and rotation it started from.

One simple solution is to perform an extra extrusion by asking the beetle to move zero steps after the loop:

![](thick_tube_code.png)

### Sphere

Extruding with zero-movement steps lets you generate revolution solids rather easily.

For example, revolving around a center point while extruding a circle will generate a sphere.

![](sphere.png)

However, the internal geometry of this sphere is a bit wrong. The Beetle extension does its best to guess what you meant, but some 3D experts will frown upon this sphere. Some of the facets are facing inside-out, and there is also an internal circular face that is certainly not needed, since it'll never see the light of day.

Both the wireframe and ghost mode toggles can help you visualize what your geometry really looks like.

![](sphere_wireframe.png)

Most 3D software will take this sphere without flinching, but others will complain that the geometry is not correct and show it to you like it really is:

![](cura_errors.png) ![](meshlab_errors.png)

### Sphere with Proper Geometry

The proper way to make a sphere is to revolve an open semicircle so that only the outer shell is generated, and with its facets always facing the correct way.

![](proper_sphere.png)

The geometry now looks perfectly fine in wireframe mode.

![](proper_sphere_wireframe.png)

Additionally, all 3D software renders it properly with no complaints about reverse facets or internal faces.

![](cura_ok.png) ![](meshlab_ok.png)

### Cone

A cone can be undestood as a revolution of a triangle. You could, thus, extrude a triangle while turning around the Z axis and moving zero steps at each rotation.

![](cone.png)

However, similarly to what happened with the sphere example, the resulting shape will be frowned upon by some 3D software:

![](meshlab_errors_cone.png)

Just like before, the culprits are some of the faces that have ended up inside-out.

### Cone with Proper Geometry

To get a proper cone we will have to revolve two lines forming an acute angle.

![](angle_revolution.png)

This can be easily achieved by passing in a list of three points that describe an acute angle to the ![](start_extruding_block.png) block. This will also let us change the radius and height of the cone rather easily.

![](proper_cone.png)

A different way to think of a cone is as a circular extrusion that scales down into a point while being extruded.

The 3D Beetle extension provides a block that lets you change the scale of the extrusion base, as well as the scale of the movement of the beetle.

To make a cone, you can start by extruding a 0-step circle, then setting the shape scale to zero, then moving as many steps as deep you want your cone to be.

![](scaled_cone.png)

### Staired Pyramid

A pyramid can also be thought of in different ways. An obvious one is to stack a bunch of flat square boxes one on top of the other in decreasing sizes.

![](pyramid_sketch.png)

To achieve this in the 3D Beetle extension you can again make use of the shape scale.

![](pyramid.png)

Notice how, for each floor, you first need to create a zero-length extrusion. Otherwise, your pyramid would lack any stairs.

Another way to think of a pyramid is as a four-stepped revolution 3of a stairwell. For each corner, the Beetle needs to rotate 90º and set an extrusion step by moving zero steps.

![](crude_stairwell_pyramid.png)

Of course, listing all the points for the stairwell by hand is going to be a very tedious job if you want the pyramid to have any more floors.

A rather cumbersome loop could do the trick, but there are more elegant ways to generate the stairwell. This is where mixing the 3D world of the beetle and the 2D world of Snap<em>!</em> shines. We can just tell a sprite to walk in a stair pattern using regular turtle geometry, and store the sprite position at each of the steps.

For clarity, you could get the sprite to draw the stairwell on the stage so you can see what the profile will look like. Notice how it's important to not close the shape if you don't want to end up with unwanted internal faces, while it's also important to add a horizontal line at the bottom if you want the pyramid to have a bottom face.

![](stair_turtle.png)

Now you don't need the pen code anymore. You can just create a temporary variable and push all the positions into it, then use it as the base shape of your extrusion. While you're at it, you can make the movement steps smaller else you end up with a real-sized pyramid!

![](stairwell_base.png)

The same code from before will now generate a ten-story pyramid.

![](ten_story_pyramid.png)


## Advanced Examples

### Snail Shell

This is a classic example brought straight from Beetle Blocks. You begin by making a torus, or a doughnut, with a circular extrusion.

![](torus.png)

Wrapping the torus in another loop that rotates around another axis will create a doubly looped shape. 1Note that this operation can get rather slow on some browsers.

If you perform the secondary rotation on the y axis (up/down, or pitch) you will end up with a sort of yarn ball.

![](yarn_ball.png)

But performing the secondary rotation on the x axis (clockwise/counter-clockwise, or roll) will yield a torus of toruses.

![](supertorus.png)

If you now increase the scale of both movement and shape by a little factor after each inner torus, you'll end up with a shape ressembling a snail shell.

![](snail.png)

Of course, nothing stops you from making it more pleasing to the eye by playing a little bit with the pen color.

![](color_snail.png)

### Pine Tree

The traditional Beetle Blocks way to generate a pine tree would be to extrude a bunch of long cylinders in a circle, then repeat that circle while going up the trunk and scaling it down a bit for each floor until reaching the top of the tree.

While this is a valid exercise, it is also interesting to generate the tree in a different way by revolving a 2D zig-zag pattern.

![](tree.png)

A similar tree can be generated by extruding a succession of smaller and smaller rather flat cones. This method will also allow you to tweak the color of each floor independently.
